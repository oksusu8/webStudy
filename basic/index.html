        <h1>Turtle</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Turtles are an order of reptiles known as Testudines, characterized by a special 
            shell developed mainly from their ribs. Modern turtles are divided into two major groups,
             the Pleurodira (side necked turtles) and Cryptodira (hidden necked turtles), 
             which differ in the way the head retracts. There are 360 living and recently 
             extinct species of turtles, including land-dwelling tortoises and freshwater terrapins. 
             They are found on most continents, some islands and, in the case of sea turtles, 
             much of the ocean. Like other amniotes (reptiles, birds, and mammals) they breathe 
            air and do not lay eggs underwater, although many species live in or around water.

            Turtle shells are made mostly of bone; the upper part is the domed carapace, 
            while the underside is the flatter plastron or belly-plate. Its outer surface is covered
             in scales made of keratin, the material of hair, horns, and claws. The carapace bones 
             develop from ribs that grow sideways and develop into broad flat plates that join up to cover the body.

        <h2>Naming and etymology</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            The word turtle is borrowed from the French word tortue or tortre 'turtle, tortoise'.[3] 
            It is a common name and may be used without 
            knowledge of taxonomic distinctions. In North America, it may denote the order as a whole.
            In Britain, the name is used for sea turtles as opposed to freshwater terrapins and land-dwelling tortoises. In Australia, which lacks true tortoises (family Testudinidae), non-marine turtles were traditionally 
            called tortoises, but more recently turtle has been used for the entire group.[4]

        <h2>Anatomy and physiology</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>Size</h3>
        <p>The largest living species of turtle (and fourth-largest reptile) is the leatherback turtle, which can reach over 2.7 m (8 ft 10 in) in length and weigh over 500 kg (1,100 lb).[9] The largest known turtle was Archelon ischyros, a Late Cretaceous sea turtle up to 4.5 m (15 ft) long, 5.25 m (17 ft) wide between the tips of the front flippers, and estimated to have weighed over 2,200 kg (4,900 lb).[10] The smallest living turtle is Chersobius signatus of South Africa, 
            measuring no more than 10 cm (3.9 in) in length[11] and weighing 172 g (6.1 oz)</p>
        <h3>Shell</h3>
        <p>
            The shell of a turtle is unique among vertebrates and serves to protect the animal and provide shelter from the elements.[13][14][15] It is primarily made of 50â€“60 bones and consists of two parts: the domed, dorsal (back) carapace and the flatter, ventral (belly) plastron. 
            They are connected by lateral (side) extensions of the plastron.[13][16]
